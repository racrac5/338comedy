[ dissolve to set ]

Steve Doocy: Welcome back to the third hour of “Fox and Friends”! I’m Steve Doocy. With me, as always, is Gretchen Carlson and Brian Kilmeade!

Gretchen Carlson: Morning!

Brian Kilmeade: Happy Monday!

Steve Doocy: Well, we ALMOST had a government shutdown!

Gretchen Carlson: Ohhhh, that was CLOSE! [ she laughs ]

Brian Kilmeade: WOW!

Steve Doocy: Late Friday night, John Boehner rescued a budget plan, which meant NO government workers would be sent home.

Gretchen Carlson: I’ll tell you who I would send home —

Steve Doocy: Oh, don’t say it, Gretchen…

Gretchen Carlson: No, no, no! President… Obama!

Steve Doocy: Oh, here she goes!

Gretchen Carlson: No! I’m sorry, but he is NOT… a leader. He needs to take… a time-out.

Brian Kilmeade: I mean, we almost had the FIRST government shutdown in the HISTORY of this country!

Gretchen Carlson: Is that — is that true?

Brian Kilmeade: Oh, I just assumed.

Steve Doocy: Our — well, how about we DON’T assume? Let’s ask our fact checker! Lou?

[ cut to the off-camera area, where a war veteran checks a few sheets of papers, then salutes the anchors ]

Gretchen Carlson: Our fact checker Lou, always keeping us honest! [ she laughs ]

Steve Doocy: So the government ISN’T shut down, but here’s a program I WOULDN’T mind seeing shut down — Michelle Obama’s anti-childhoood obesity task force!

Gretchen Carlson: Ohhhh, thank you! Okay, FIRST of all — when I hear “task force”, I get scared!

Brian Kilmeade: What? Uh-huh!

Steve Doocy: If kids hear there’s a TASK FORCE at school, maybe they stay home SICK!!

Brian Kilmeade: Kids scare easy. I remember when I was in high school, I heard a rumor that our janitor was a serial killer! And I was so scared, I stayed home sick for an entire MONTH! I missed out on a LOT of vocab — [ sadly ] I still don’t know what “eclectic” means.

Steve Doocy: And, also, maybe this is just me — but what’s so wrong with a few FAT KIDS in school?

Gretchen Carlson: THANK YOU for saying that! Okay, I LOVE fatties!! Alright? They’re FUNNY!!

Brian Kilmeade: They are funny, they are so eclectic!

Steve Doocy: Hey, absolutely! Here’s a scary question: When there are NO fat kids, who’s gonna play the comic relief in Disney movies?

Gretchen Carlson: Yeah, you know what? I will tell you who!

Brian Kilmeade: Uh-oh!

Steve Doocy: Uh-oh! Be careful, Gretchen!

Gretchen Carlson: No, no! Mexicans!

Steve Doocy: Look out!

Gretchen Carlson: No, no, no — it’s true! When American kids get too skinny, chubby Mexicans will take American acting jobs! Okay? Just look at the kid on “Modern Family”!

Steve Doocy: Who is great! He’s great!

Gretchen Carlson: But, but maybe soon… it won’t be the eagle on the American flag… it will be the… [ thinking ] What’s a Mexican bird?

Brian Kilmeade: A burrito.

Gretchen Carlson: That’s not a bird.

Brian Kilmeade: Ah — yeah! [ he chuckles ] A chicken burrito!

Steve Doocy: Well! Scary stuff! Joining us now, she’s the President of the Eagle Coalition Fireworks Emporium in Yuma, Arizona. Please welcome… Sandy Blunt!

[ cut to Sandy Blunt, Border War Expert, on satellite ]

Sandy Blunt: Proud to be here. Proud to be an American.

Brian Kilmeade: So what’s new on the border war, Sandy?

Sandy Blunt: Well, you know… we all know about the dangers of anchor babies.

Gretchen Carlson: Anchor babies, of course, being illegal immigrants coming to America, who have their babies on our soil, making them U.S. citizens.

Brian Kilmeade: Oh!

Steve Doocy: SO scary!

Brian Kilmeade: So scary…

Sandy Blunt: Well… now there is a NEW threat on our doorsteps: Mexicans are kidnapping pregnant American women, and taking them to Mexico! Then… when the women give birth… their beautiful babies… will be… I’m sorry! Mexicans!

Brian Kilmeade: [ blinking ] So you’re saying…?

Sandy Blunt: REVERSE ANCHOR BABIES!! Undercover Mexicans in America! You know — known as A-Merx-icans!

Steve Doocy: Aye carumba!

Brian Kilmeade: Wow. Thanks, Sandy. Scary stuff… scary stuff.

Steve Doocy: Now, there’s been a lot of talk aout BIRTH CERTIFICATES recently, so I thought it would be fun, you know, to all bring in OUR birth certificates, just to show how easy it is?

Gretchen Carlson: Yeah! Yeah!

Steve Doocy: Here’s mine! [ he holds it up ]

Gretchen Carlson: Here’s mine! [ she holds it up ]

Brian Kilmeade: And here’s mine. [ he holds up a Dave and Buster’s gift certificate ]

Steve Doocy: I’m, uh — I’m not sure that’s it, Brian!

Brian Kilmeade: But it has my name on it.

Gretchen Carlson: Uh — it’s from Dave and Buster’s!

Brian Kilmeade: Mmm… but I got it on my birthday, so it counts!
