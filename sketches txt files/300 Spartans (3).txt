               The year is 480 BCE, during the second Persian invasion
               of Greece. King Leonidas of Sparta leads his 300 soldiers
               in an attempt to delay the Persian forces, led by General
               Xerxes. History can only imagine the words exchanged
               before this battle.

Leonidas stands at the front of his group of warriors.



                              LEONIDAS
               This! Is where we fight! This! Is where ​they ​die! We may
               number only 300. We may be up against one million. But
               We are Spartans!

                                POLYDOROS
               ...Wow, Leonidas, you’re fucking high if you think we’re
               fighting after that.

                              LEONIDAS
               What?

                              CLEOMENES
               300 against a million? Polydoros is right, what the Hades
               kind of a pep talk was that?

                              POLYDOROS
               Awful posture, no eye contact, and would it hurt you to use
               a few hand gestures? Bad motivator.

                              LEONIDAS
               But we’re fighters! We’re Spartans!

                             CLEOMENES
               Yeah, and I’m an Ares moon, but you don’t see me being
               delusional about my own strength.

                              POLYDOROS
I think someone’s been digesting a little too much ​Plato​.
Did you really think we’d be psyched to fight a ​million ​of
them?

                 LEONIDAS
I didn’t think th---

              CLEOMENES
You’re goddamn right you didn’t think. I joined the war so I
could look good with my shirt off, not for any of this shit.

               LEONIDAS
You have to fight! I have command over you!

              POLYDOROS
Oh, yeah, and my wife’s Aphrodite. Please, you don’t even
have command over your own bowels.

                 CLEOMENES
Also, killing a million people is basically genocide. So even
in our best case scenario here, I’m committing a war crime
and setting myself up for a lifetime of guilt.

                 POLYDOROS
Besides, emperor Xerxes’ name backwards is Sexrex, and
that’s rad, so I don’t want to hit him.

              LEONIDAS
Guys, please just…

             CLEOMENES
Please? ​When’s the last time you heard a commander say
please?

                POLYDOROS
It sure wasn’t Alexander the Great’s catchphrase.

                LEONIDAS
If we don’t fight then Athens will burn!

               POLYDOROS & CLEOMENES
Oooooooo.
                         POLYDOROS
             Hey, Cleomenes, what do we think of Athens? We think
             they’re...

                            CLEOMENES & POLYDOROS
             Trash.
                          CLEOMENES
             Those nerds can bite my Ath.

                            POLYDOROS
             Oh, what, you think you’re so smart just because you
             invented the pillar. Stupid city. Makes me so mad.

                            CLEOMENES
             Now there’s a group of people I could get behind killing.
             “Let’s name our city after the goddess of wisdom and
             everyone will think we’re smart.”

                              POLYDOROS
             If it were up to me, we’d still be fighting that Athens-Sparta
             war. Like, do they not remember how bad they lost?

                              LEONIDAS
             Well, I guess now that you’ve been mentioning it, maybe
             fighting isn’t entirely necessar-

                            POLYDOROS & CLEOMENES
             OHHHHHH

Polydoros and Cleomenes do a slow clap together, synchronized.

                          POLYDOROS
             How the mighty have fallen.

                            CLEOMENES
             Captain doesn’t always go down with his ship I guess,
             huh?

                           POLYDOROS
             You were going to throw away our lives for something it
             took us two minutes to argue you out of.
              CLEOMENES
Leonidas more like Leon-doesn’t-stick-to-his-ideals.

               POLYDOROS
Ridiculous.

              CLEOMENES
Don’t be a wimp.

               LEONIDAS
What?

             CLEOMENES
Yeah, come on, we should fight.

              POLYDOROS
My adrenaline’s all worked up now thinking about those
Athenian pricks and you’re gonna ask me to calm down?
No way, I’m punching some Persians.

              LEONIDAS
!*!PUNCH Ok, then…. I guess….. To battle!   !*!

               VOICEOVER
That day, the 300 warriors of Sparta put on the greatest
military show in history, defeating nearly all of the invading
forces…. Even though, they all died.
