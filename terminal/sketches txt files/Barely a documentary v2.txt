BARELY, a documentary

EXT. A FOREST -- DAY


Bird song cascades through the forest canopy as our hero, D-MONEY, carefully sneaks across stage. He settles down into a crouch position on one side. A moment later, two BEARS, BARRY and BEAU, emerge and sniff the ground. D-Money gives a nature-doc voiceover into a microphone from the side of the stage. 


D-MONEY
Here we have two of the Rockies’ finest natural predators. The grizzly bear. When two grizzlies come across each other in the woods, it usually leads to instant conflict. Let’s watch. 


The bears do a mix of growls and roars that eventually becomes decipherable. Beau approaches the camera. 


BEAU
(acting, dramatic and educational)
Here I sit, a bear in the forest, my natural habitat. I certainly hope that deforestation will not ever destroy this beautiful home!


BARRY
(growling, bad acting)
                Me bear. Me kill you.


BEAU
What? What are you doing? The camera turns on and you turn dumb? 


BARRY  
(badly lying)
Oh is there a camera? I hadn’t noticed.


BEAU
You, a bear, a natural born killer, didn’t notice the 6 foot tall piece of meat standing fourteen feet away from you with a boom mic? 


BARRY
I don’t see meat. I’m a vegan.


BEAU
Oh bull shit. Since when? 


D-MONEY
These arguments are quite common for the bears, much more so than in our civilized society.


BARRY
Come on, just act like a bear. 


BEAU
I am a bear! Bears are smart. We’re sophisticated. We have to educated them about our needs!  I will not lower myself to their derogatory expectations. 


D-MONEY
When these disputes get heated like this, it’s usually over a mate. Let’s see who wins the right to breed. 


BEAU
You hear that?! You think you’re helping bears by pushing stereotypes like that? 


BARRY
(growling)
My children would be stronger than yours! Therefore I must procreate! 


BEAU
...What--What is this? Who is making you be like this?


BARRY
...I got a brand deal. 


BEAU
Oh WOW. Real cool. Selling out. What is this magical brand that’s making you betray your whole species?
 
BARRY
I don’t want to say. 


BEAU
Well, the camera’s rolling, pal. 


Barry walks to the front of the stage. 


D-MONEY
Remarkable. One of the bears seems to be investigating our camera. These shots are once in a lifetime. Watch very carefully.


Barry picks up a fireman’s hat from behind him. He puts the hat on and, ashamed, plays to the camera.


BEAU
Oh, Don’t you dare. 


BARRY
Only you can prevent forest fires. 


BEAU
Smokey is supposed to be Californian! You are from Wyoming. 


BARRY
Well, with all the fires this year, there weren’t exactly a lot of bears left in California to play the part now were there? 


BEAU
Now you’re taking advantage of natural disasters for your own monetary profit? You should be telling the humans about the importance of preservation! 


BARRY
For bears to be taken seriously, the humans have to have a bear celebrity. And I plan to get there.


BEAU
Yeah, I’m sure you’ll be taken so seriously when Charmin has you wiping your ass on screen. They don’t even give Pooh Bear pants, Barry! He is an object! 


BARRY
There are other bear roles out there. Nice roles. 


BEAU
                Like what? 


BARRY
Like, I could join the circus! 


They stand up, now yelling at each other. 


D-MONEY
Watch as they adopt their battle stances. 


BEAU
I accidentally walked near a picnic the other day and a woman screamed. Not because she was surprised, because she thought I was going to steal her picnic basket! What you’re doing is hurting bears’ reputation!


BARRY
Some bears steal! 


BEAU
Really? Do you not see how problematic your argument is?


They are in each other’s faces. Beau raises a hand as if to strike Barry. 


D-MONEY
This fight is for life and death. As it must be in the wild.


Beau looks at D-Money. He lowers his arm and backs away. 


BEAU
I won’t give them what they want. 


He sits, arms crossed, staring at Barry. Barry approaches and attempts to re-square up, but Beau is motionless. Barry slaps him across the face with his paw. A beat. 


BEAU
I loved you once. 


Barry hits again, knocking Beau over. 


BARRY
Fight back! Fight back, you asshole! Fight back! 


D-MONEY
...If the dominant grizzly backs down now, it will be seen as an act of weakness. Gruesome as it is, folks, it’s the law of Mother Nature. 


Barry kicks Beau repeatedly, until there is no motion left. He shakes Beau. 


BARRY
Come on. Get up! 


Barry is stunned. He looks down at his paws, stunned and ashamed by his actions. He bear-ies his head in his hands. 


BARRY
What have I done?


D-MONEY
We can only imagine what the bear is thinking. How does he understand his actions in nature?


Sobbing, Barry approaches the camera. He sticks a thumbs-up in front of his chest. 


BARRY
(reluctantly a corporate shill, singing like the Jungle Book through tears)
!*!PUNCH   It’s the simple bare necessities of life.    !*!
